# Tim Loughrist, PhD
## Software engineer | Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React.js

I spent the first two decades of my professional life as an analytic philosopher. After earning tenure, I found grew restless and decided to branch out and explore new challenges.

Because Iâ€™ve always had a love of formal logic, rules, and system building, my transition into software development was surprisingly smooth. I enjoy the work I do (with a special fondness for debugging) and look forward to it every morning.

Outside of coding and philosophy, I am an avid tabletop gamer, bicycle aficionado, and consumer of coffee.

### Current Projects ###

* Cadence, an app to analyze a music file to determine BPM and recommend it for a particular running cadence
